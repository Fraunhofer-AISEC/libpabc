One problem with the concept of aggregated claims [1] in combination with JSON-Web-Tokns is excessive disclosure of information.
Anonymous credentials such as Camenisch-Lysyanskaya [2] using blind signature schemes such as BBS+ can be used to enable selective disclosure of attributes, such signature schemes are not explicitly defined for the OIDC Aggregated Claims standard.

For the [DISSENS](https://wiki.geant.org/display/NGITrust/Funded+Projects+Call+2#FundedProjectsCall2-DISSENS) project, we have implemented libpabc:
A library that supports non-interactive zero knowledge proofs for anonymoud credentials using pairings on a BLS12-381 curve [3].
In combination with a suitable SSI system, users can selectively disclose attributes from a credential without invalidating the issuerâ€™s signature.
